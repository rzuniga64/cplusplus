Problem 5. Array functions: Write and test the following functions. 
Consider adding them to the
ArrayFunctions.cpp file that was posted after lecture.

a. sumPerfect: An integer is said to be a perfect number if the sum of 
its divisors (including 1 but
not the number itself) is equal to the number. Given a function called 
isPerfect, which receives
an integer and returns a bool indicating whether the integer is perfect, 
sumPerfect should return
the sum of all the perfect numbers in the array.

b. clipArray: Given the function below, the clipArray function should receive 
an array of real
numbers (and its size) and a minimum and maximum value. Each element in the 
array that is
below the minimum should be replaced by the minimum, and elements above the 
maximum should
replaced by the maximum.
double clip(double val, double min, double max) {
    return (val < min ? min : (val > max ? max : val));
}

c. arrayMax: Receives an array of real numbers (and its size) and a reference 
to another integer,
maxIdx. The function
